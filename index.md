## What is Omeka?
[Omeka](https://omeka.org/classic/) is an open-sourced content management system (CMS) developed by the [Roy Rosenzweig Center of History and New Media at George Mason University](https://rrchnm.org/). Omeka was created to share digital collections and build online exhibits. It has an easy to use interface that allows users to create websites without any coding. In this tutorial, we will go through how to add items (and metadata about those items) to a digital collections in Omeka and then create rich exhibits using those collections.

### Example Projects
Omeka has been used since 2007 in a wide variety of projects. You can view example project in the [Omeka Classic Directory](https://omeka.org/classic/directory/). Take a few minutes to look through some of the different projects built on the platform. 

The University of Oklahoma Libraries' Digital Scholarship Lab (DSL) has been involved in the creation of several Omeka sites. Here are two examples from our Lab. 
* [Making of Modern America: Discovering the Great Depression and New Deal](http://newdeal.oucreate.com/)
* [Project Jordan: The Wives of English Kings](http://www.jordanproject.oucreate.com/)

### Which Omeka to Use?
Omeka has several different derivatives depending on your needs. The tutorial will be using a self hosted version of Omeka classic; however, the instructions will likely transfer over to other versions with little difficulty.If you want to learn more about the different iterations of omeka, please see the descriptions below. 

**For students, faculty, and staff at the University of Oklahoma, please see our [tutorial on getting started with OU Create and Omeka](https://oudsl.github.io/OUCreate_and_Omeka/).**

The first distinction is **omeka.net vs omeka.org**. Omeka.net is Omeka's hosted service. You create an account and have access to a limited number of plugins and storage. [Programming Historian has a great tutorial on using getting started with omeka.net](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/up-and-running-with-omeka). The advantages of using omeka.net are that it is easy to set up and you don't need access to a server or IT support to install Omeka on said server. The disadvantages are the lack of storage and ability to access the full range of plugins. The self-hosted omeka downloaded from omeka.org gives you much more flexibility. OU users can easily create a self-hosted site omeka site using [OU Create](https://create.ou.edu/).

Another newer distinction is Omeka Classic vs Omeka S. Omeka Classic is the standard omeka site while Omeka S is useful if you are managing multiple omeka websites. For this tutorial, we will be using Omeka Classic.

### Additional Resources
Much of the material in this tutorial is adapted from [Omeka's documentation](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/). You can refer to this if you have questions outside the scope of this tutorial. The [Omeka forums](https://forum.omeka.org/) are also a rich source of information. OU students, faculty, and staff can also schedule consultations with the [DSL staff](https://libraries.ou.edu/employees?combine=&field_title_value=&field_departments_tid=399).

For example, if your Omeka site's URL is omeka.oucreate.com, type in omeka.oucreate.com/admin. 

This url will direct you to a log in screen for your site. Please enter the username and password you selected when you created the site. If you have forgotten your password, you can using the **Lost your password link** at the bottom of the log in box to reset it.

After logging in, you will be redirected to your dashboard. This is your base of operations for controlling the content of the website. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the interface. 

There are two main ways of accessing different areas of the site. The main navigation bar is on the left side of the screen. You can also navigate to some of the sections of the dashboard by clicking the numbers on the top center of the page. The numbers are reflective of all of the content on the Omeka site.

The dashboard will also quickly show you the items and collections that have been edited most recently.

## Items
ITEMS are the building blocks of your Omeka site. An item is any sort of resource you add to Omeka. Items can include images of archival documents, photographs, audio recordings, and videos. You will create collections and exhibits using your items. 

Click **Items** on the navigation bar to go to the main items page. Here you will see a list of items have already been added to the site. You will have options to **Add an Item**, **Show Details** and **Search Items**.
