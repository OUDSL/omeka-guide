## What is Omeka?
[Omeka](https://omeka.org/classic/) is an open-sourced CMS developed by the [Roy Rosenzweig Center of History and New Media at George Mason University](https://rrchnm.org/). Omeka was created to share digital collections and build online exhibits. It has an easy to use interface that allows users to create websites without any coding. In this tutorial, we will go through how to add items (and metadata about those items) to a digital collections in Omeka and then create rich exhibits using those collections.

### Example Projects
Omeka has been used since 2007 in a wide variety of projects. You can view example project in the [Omeka Classic Directory](https://omeka.org/classic/directory/). Take a few minutes to look through some of the different projects built on the platform. 

The University of Oklahoma Libraries' Digital Scholarship Lab (DSL) has been involved in the creation of several Omeka sites. Here are two examples from our Lab. 
* [Making of Modern America: Discovering the Great Depression and New Deal](http://newdeal.oucreate.com/)
* [Project Jordan: The Wives of English Kings](http://www.jordanproject.oucreate.com/)

### Which Omeka to Use?
Omeka has several different derivatives depending on your needs. The tutorial will be using a self hosted version of Omeka classic; however, the instructions will likely transfer over to other versions with little difficulty.If you want to learn more about the different iterations of omeka, please see the descriptions below. 

**For students, faculty, and staff at the University of Oklahoma, please see our [tutorial on getting started with OU Create and Omeka](https://oudsl.github.io/OUCreate_and_Omeka/).**

The first distinction is **omeka.net vs omeka.org**. Omeka.net is Omeka's hosted service. You create an account and have access to a limited number of plugins and storage. [Programming Historian has a great tutorial on using getting started with omeka.net](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/up-and-running-with-omeka). The advantages of using omeka.net are that it is easy to set up and you don't need access to a server or IT support to install Omeka on said server. The disadvantages are the lack of storage and ability to access the full range of plugins. The self-hosted omeka downloaded from omeka.org gives you much more flexibility. OU users can easily create a self-hosted site omeka site using [OU Create](https://create.ou.edu/).

Another newer distinction is Omeka Classic vs Omeka S. Omeka Classic is the standard omeka site while Omeka S is useful if you are managing multiple omeka websites. For this tutorial, we will be using Omeka Classic.

### Additional Resources
Much of the material in this tutorial is adapted from [Omeka's documentation](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/). You can refer to this if you have questions outside the scope of this tutorial. The [Omeka forums](https://forum.omeka.org/) are also a rich source of information. OU students, faculty, and staff can also schedule consultations with the [DSL staff](https://libraries.ou.edu/employees?combine=&field_title_value=&field_departments_tid=399).
